# Test queue: changes waiting for a run on a real TC100

Several agents work on this repository. The ones without the camera write code; another one runs it on the camera.
This file is the hand-off between them. **Implementers:** add an entry for every change that needs the camera, with a
switch to turn it off. **Testers:** run the entries, write the result under the entry (date, camera, build, numbers),
set the status, and, when it passes, make the change the default in a follow-up commit (or say why not).

Status values: `to test`, `testing`, `passed`, `failed`, `blocked`.

Rules that apply to every entry:
- Test kernels boot from the SD card in RAM (`pack66/boot66b.sh`, `tc100test/c66.img`); nothing is written to the flash.
  Check that `/proc/cmdline` holds the full initrd size. **U-Boot keeps only 256 characters of `bootargs`**: add the
  kernel parameters below at the end, and check that none of them was cut off.
- Changes to `tc100_rtsp` can be tried without a reboot: `v3/dev/try-rtsp.sh CAMERA BINARY [VAR=value]`, or switches in
  `/mnt/config/rtsp.env` followed by a restart of the server (`controlscripts/rtsp-h26x restart`).
- The CI build of a change is the run whose title starts with the commit's prefix (`[hwaccel]` for the entries below):
  artifact `tc100-linux66-cma16-kernel` (`oipc.img`, `tc100test/*`, `tc100_rtsp`).
- Measure with the `STAT` lines of `/tmp/logs/tc100_rtsp.log`, `scripts/cpu-profile.sh 60`, `/proc/meminfo`
  (`MemAvailable`), `/proc/interrupts` (two reads 60 s apart), and look at the picture (snapshot, VLC).

## Hardware use and memory (2026-10-30, commits `[hwaccel] ...`)

Context: [hardware-acceleration.md](hardware-acceleration.md). None of this was compiled or run before it was pushed
(no compiler on the author's machine): the first check is that the CI run is green.

### HW-01 No picture copy in the encoder pool with direct capture — `to test`
- **What:** `tc100_rtsp` allocated a 3.4 MB copy of the main and sub pictures in the encoder pool even when the encoder
  reads the capture buffers (direct capture, the default). It now allocates it only in copy mode (`RTSP_DIRECT=0`), and
  only the 0.35 MB sub picture when the sub picture is made by the CPU (`RTSP_HWSUB=0`). The H.265 warm-up frame is
  encoded from the capture buffer too.
- **Test:** the log says `encoder pool: no picture copy (direct capture and the ISP sub channel)`. The `pool used ..., free ...`
  lines after both encoders open: write down **used** with the main stream in H.265 and the sub-stream on, and again in
  H.264. Video, sub-stream and snapshots as before. Then the same with `RTSP_DIRECT=0` (copy mode must still work).
- **Pass:** free pool about 3.4 MB larger than before; no `ak_venc_open failed`; 15 fps.
- **Gives:** the pool size for HW-02 (largest "used" + 0.5 MB).

### HW-02 Encoder pool from a reusable CMA area, size on the command line (kernel patch 0015) — `to test`
- **What:** the 12 MiB `no-map` region of the encoder became a CMA area of its own. The driver takes the pool from it
  at boot; `ak39_venc.pool=<size>` takes less, and the rest is usable by the kernel. Default (no parameter) = 12 MiB,
  same as before.
- **Test 1 (default):** dmesg `video encoder: ... pool 12288 KiB at 0x81800000 (CMA)`; video, sub-stream, JPEG as before;
  `MemTotal` 12 MiB higher than before and `MemAvailable` unchanged.
- **Test 2:** with the size from HW-01, e.g. `ak39_venc.pool=8M`: `MemAvailable` higher by the difference (about
  4 MB); both encoders open, recording with the sub-stream works, one hour of streaming without `ak_venc_open failed`
  or kernel errors. Then H.265 + H.264 sub, and a client switching codecs (Settings → Video).
- **Fail / revert:** no `/dev/uio0` or `cannot map the ... pool` in dmesg: boot the previous kernel. Pool too small:
  drop the parameter.
- **If it passes:** put the measured size in `flashargs` / `stock-hook.sh` (U-Boot environment: ask the owner first),
  or as the default in the device tree (`anyka,pool-size` is not used for CMA; change `reg` size or add a default in
  the driver).

### HW-03 USB host: FIFO data in 32-bit words (kernel patch 0013, `otg_hs.fifo32=1`) — `to test`
- **What:** the Wi-Fi USB host moved every byte of a packet with its own bus access. With `otg_hs.fifo32=1` it moves
  32-bit words (tail bytes as before). Off by default. Can be switched live:
  `echo 1 > /sys/module/otg_hs/parameters/fifo32` (do it from the **serial console**: Wi-Fi is the only network).
- **Test:** with one client playing H.265 at 15 fps, before and after the switch: USB line of `/proc/interrupts` per
  second, system and idle % (`cpu-profile.sh 60`), STAT `cap` (74-76 per 5 s). Then 30 min with `fifo32=1`: no image
  corruption, no `rtl8xxxu` errors, `OverFlow` or `-EPROTO` in dmesg; restart the access point and check that the camera
  reconnects and gets its DHCP lease.
- **Pass:** lower system %, same interrupt rate (one per packet is unchanged), stable Wi-Fi. Then default `fifo32` to 1
  in a follow-up patch.
- **Also note:** the USB interrupt rate **with no video client**. If it stays near 1000/s, the start-of-frame interrupt
  is kept on for an interrupt endpoint of `rtl8xxxu`: the next fix would let the hardware poll that endpoint
  (see the patch description).
- **Not done:** DMA. The vendor DMA path (`CONFIG_USB_AKOTG_DMA`) unmaps buffers usbcore already maps (and with a NULL
  device), may write past the end of an RX buffer and does not handle short / zero-length packets; it needs a rework.

### HW-04 Privacy masks by the ISP (`RTSP_ISPMASK=1`) — `to test`
- **What:** `AK_ISP_SET_MAIN_CHAN_MASK_AREA`, `_SUB_CHAN_MASK_AREA`, `_MASK_COLOR` (as the 2.x firmware did through the
  vendor library: opaque, type 0, alpha 0) instead of painting the areas in every frame. Off by default because a mask
  in the wrong place is a privacy failure.
- **Test:** draw 2 masks on the Image page (one in a corner, one in the middle), `RTSP_ISPMASK=1` in `rtsp.env`, restart
  the server. Log: `privacy masks: 2 in the ISP`. Check main stream, sub-stream (`/ch1`), snapshot and a recording: the
  areas are covered exactly where the editor shows them, in black, grey and white. Remove the masks: they disappear.
- **Pass:** then make it the default (`mask_hw` starts at 1 unless `RTSP_ISPMASK=0`).

### HW-05 Sharpness by the ISP (Image page, `SHARPNESS`) — `to test`
- **What:** the Sharpness slider is back on the Image page. `tc100_rtsp` scales the tuning file's medium and high
  frequency gains (`AK_ISP_SET_SHARP`, manual and 9 gain-linked sets) by 2 % per step. On by default (nothing is written
  while the slider is at 0).
- **Test:** live tuning on, sharpness -50, 0, +50: log `sharpness: N in the ISP (medium a -> b, high c -> d)`; the
  picture gets softer / sharper (compare snapshots of the same scene); bit rate goes down / up a little. The "Applied on
  the camera" line under the form shows the value.
- **Fail:** picture broken or unchanged at ±50: note the logged gains; `RTSP_ISPTUNE` does not cover it, set SHARPNESS=0.

### HW-06 Exposure cap by the ISP (Image page, `EXPOSURE_MAX_PCT`) — `to test`
- **What:** the Exposure time cap slider is back. `AK_ISP_SET_AE` `exp_time_max` = the tuning file's value × percent,
  never below `exp_time_min` (the 2.x firmware did the same through the vendor library).
- **Test:** in low light, 100 % (off) then 30 %: log `exposure cap: 30 % (exp_time_max A -> B)`; moving things blur less,
  the picture is darker. `/tmp/cam_ae` (HW-08) shows `exp_time` not above B.

### HW-07 Clock by the ISP OSD (`RTSP_ISPOSD=1`, kernel patch 0014) — `to test`
- **What:** new ioctls `AK_ISP_SET_OSD_COLOR_TABLE` / `AK_ISP_SET_OSD` reach the ISP's on-screen display code (window 0,
  4 bits per pixel, 16 colours, swapped at the next frame). `tc100_rtsp` draws the clock into it once a second instead
  of into each frame (and no cache clean of those rows). Off by default; any refusal falls back to the CPU clock.
- **Test:** OSD on in Settings → Video, `RTSP_ISPOSD=1`, restart. Log: `clock: in the ISP OSD (WxH at x,y)`. The clock
  shows on the main stream and in snapshots, ticks every second, black box, white digits, same place as before.
- **Unknowns to settle:** nibble order (garbled digits: `RTSP_OSD_NIBBLE=1`), alpha (box transparent or invisible:
  try `RTSP_OSD_ALPHA=15`), whether colour 0 is transparent. Write down what worked; then make the values the defaults.
- **Fail:** no clock or a corrupted picture: remove `RTSP_ISPOSD`; dmesg of the ISP.

### HW-08 Exposure state for day / night (`/tmp/cam_ae`) — `to test`
- **What:** every 2 s `tc100_rtsp` writes `lumi exp_time a_gain d_gain isp_d_gain dark_flag` from
  `AK_ISP_GET_AE_RUN_INFO`. Nothing uses it yet. The day / night daemon decides from `/tmp/cam_luma`, the mean luma
  of the picture *after* auto exposure, which stays near the AE target whatever the light: exposure time and gains
  measure the scene light.
- **Test:** record `/tmp/cam_ae` and `/tmp/cam_luma` in daylight, at dusk, at night with the IR LEDs on and off.
- **Next:** if the values separate day and night clearly, switch `scripts/auto-night-daemon.sh` to them (with
  hysteresis), so the IR light itself does not flip the mode back.

### Looked at and not possible / not done (2026-10-30)
- **SD card 4-bit bus:** the SD controller's data lines 2-3 are GPIO 80 / 81, the IR-cut filter on the TC100
  (OpenIPC device tree `mci0_pins`: 0x1f-0x22 and 0x50, 0x51). The card stays 1-bit.
- **USB DMA:** see HW-03.
- **3D noise reduction:** its reference frame (about 3 MB) does not fit the capture CMA area. With HW-01/HW-02 freeing
  memory it could be tried again (`AK_ISP_SET_3D_NR_PHYADDR` is refused by the 6.6 char driver today; needs a kernel
  change to give it a buffer). Quality and bit rate at night, not CPU.
- **Anti-flicker (`POWER_HZ`):** the 2.x firmware set it through the vendor library (`ak_vpss_effect_set(6, hz)`),
  whose ISP calls are not known; the field stays hidden on 3.0.
